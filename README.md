##DESCRIPTION: A decision tree is one of the most intuitive and interpretable machine learning models used for both classification and regression tasks. It is a supervised learning algorithm where the data is continuously split according to a certain parameter. The structure resembles a tree, hence the name â€” starting from the root, it splits the dataset into branches, which in turn divided into more branches, ending in leaf nodes that represent the outcome.

In this internship task, we aim to implement and visualise a Decision Tree Classifier using the Scikit-learn library. The goal is to train a model that can classify or predict outcomes based on a given dataset. The visualisation of the decision tree will help in understanding the decision-making process of the model, which is critical in real-world applications like finance, healthcare, education, and many other domains where explainability is necessary.

We chose the popular Iris dataset, which contains measurements of different features of iris flowers from three species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica. The features include petal length, petal width, sepal length, and sepal width. This dataset is ideal for classification tasks due to its balanced classes and well-defined features.

The steps involved include:

Importing necessary libraries: This includes pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn.

Loading and exploring the dataset: Understanding the data structure, checking for missing values, and visualising distributions.

Data Preprocessing: Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.

Model Training: Fitting the Decision Tree classifier using training data.

Visualisation: Plotting the decision tree to interpret model logic.

Evaluation: Calculating accuracy, precision, recall, and the confusion matrix.

Conclusion: Analysing model performance and understanding limitations.

This task provides hands-on experience with model implementation and strengthens concepts such as entropy, information gain, overfitting, and pruning. Through this internship task, we also enhance our understanding of how decision tree classifiers function internally and how they can be visualised for better interpretability.

By the end of this notebook, we will have implemented a machine learning model and analysed it comprehensively, showcasing our data science skills in action.
